## Quick start
This is a template for setting up gogs and/or nextcloud on a server and 
it assumes a docker volumn with ssl certificates is present. If you don't
have one, use following commands to obtain certificates from
Let's Encrypt.
```bash
docker column create nginx-certs
docker run -it --rm --name certbot \
-v nginx-certs:/etc/letsencrypt \
-v $SITE_LOCATION:/data/letsencrypt \
certbot/certbot certonly --webroot -w=/data/letsencrypt \
-d example.com -m example@example.com
```
`$SITE_LOCATION` is the path to your website that is served on this machine.
If you have other valid ssl certificates, simply copy the to 
`/paht-to-certs-volumn/live/${DOMAINNAME}/` and edit `nginx.conf` to use
your private key and certificate.

For enhanced security, change `DBROOTPWD` in `.env`
to your favourite password and `DOMAIN` in `docker-compose.yml` to your
own doamin name.

You can then call `docker-comose up -d` to spin up all the services.

## Additional customizations
- `gen_db.sh` creates necessary databases if they don't exit during database
initialization. User name and password are the same as the database name.
You can edit this script to customize your database settings.

- Services can be called individually:
```bash
docker-compose up -d 			# deploy gogs and nextcloud  services
docker-compose up -d gogs		# deploy gogs
docker-compose up -d nextcloudb		# deploy nextcloud
```

- Nextcloud and gogs are accessible on host port `8888` and `3000` during the initial
setup. To use them with nginx reverse proxy server, the webroot path of nextcloud and gogs
should be set correctly. By default, gogs will be served under `domain-name/gogs`
and nextcloud `domain-name/nextcloud`. 

  - Gogs: The webroot can be changed during initial setup. Simply change the `Application URL`
to `doamin-name/gogs`. Alternatively, change `ROOT_URL` in `/path-to-gogs-volume/gogs/conf/app.ini`.
  - Nextcloud: Add `'overwritewebroot' => '/nextcloud'` in `/path-to-nextcloud-volume/config/config.php`. In addition, set `'overwrite.cli.url'` and `'htaccess.RewriteBase'` to reflect this change. See [here](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/9/admin_manual/configuration_server/config_sample_php_parameters.html) for more information.

 The path of these services can be changed in the `location` section of `nginx.conf`. Remember
to repeat the above setup to reflect the path change.

- After the initial setup and tested the services, the opened ports, `8888` and `3000` on host, can be turned to `expose`, leaving them only accessible to the reverse proxy server. The ssh port `8080`, however, should be kept only if ssh access to gos is required.

- To enable Redis caching in Nextcloud, add following lines to `config.php`:
```
'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\Redis',
'memcache.locking' => '\OC\Memcache\Redis',
'redis' => array(
	'host' => 'redis',
	'port' => 6379,
)
```
